# Section 08 Refs Portal Notes

## 142 - Introducing Refs

What is it

-   It's used to reference a value that's not needed for rendering
-   useRef returns an object with a single property, current.
-   Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render/

How can it be used for input values

-   When there is a ref on the input tag, you can then access the underlying element and all of its properties as well
