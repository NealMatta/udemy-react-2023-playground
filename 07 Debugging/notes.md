## 137 - Strict Mode

-   StrictMode is a component provided by React to be used as a component
-   **Usage**: It's typically wrapped around the App Component
-   It executes every component function twice, instead of once (just in development)
    -   When every component gets executed twice, it catches errors that aren't immediately surfaced
