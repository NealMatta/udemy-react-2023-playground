# Starting the Section

-   This is just another way of defining components. There aren't too many differences between the two options
-   Functional components are the default and most modern approach
-   Other than error boundaries, there's no reason to go to class-based components
-   Anything you can build with functional components, you can build with class-bas components
-   class bsaed components can't use react hooks

# Remaining sections

-   Since I won't be using class based components, I'm just going to take notes all together
